## This file contains functions specific to the Programming Assignment 2 
## The below pair of functions will cache the inverse of a matrix
## ---------------------------------------------------------------------

## The function makeCacheMatrix creates a special matrix object that can cache its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## The function cacheSolve computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. 
## If the inverse has already been calculated (and the matrix has not changed),
## then cacheSolve should retrieve the inverse from the cache.

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
